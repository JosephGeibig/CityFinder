                <p id = "intro" class = "">     As Graduate students, we are all at a point of our lives when we must decide where to live as we begin our careers. There are many factors that affect this decision, and those factors may not be the same for everyone. However, we believe there are a few core factors that are shared amongst all people looking to relocate and find "home". There are a few “Quality of life” measures, such as NerdWallet’s cost of living index, but they tend to be extremely general, and as a result, quite inaccurate. Furthermore, some of the metrics used by these indexes are not the best representation of what we believe people look for when they move to a new area. </p>

            <p id = "instructions"> Our tool is presented through 3 visualizations.   </p>
            <p> <b>–––</b> First is a choropleth map showing the average of all cities throughout the state for the variable you would like to see. If you would like to see the specific value for each state, you can hover over them to see the average of all cities in that state for the selected metric. 
            </p>
            <p> <b>–––</b> If you find a variable that you are interested in, you can click on a state in the choropleth to select it. Then, below the choropleth you will find a selection windows for the cities in the state. You can select one or more cities in this selection window to compare the variable in the choropleth between each city. 
            </p>
            <p> <b>–––</b> Lastly, once you have examined the other two visualizations and have determined a city that has a lot of the factors which you would like for your ideal city, you can go to our KNN model at the bottom, which is shown as a map with all cities displayed. If you click on a city, the 5 most similar cities in all metrics are highlighted on the map. If you would like to increase this number, you can in the entry box above the visualization.
